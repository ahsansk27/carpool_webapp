               <p class="article-body">Carpooling (also car-sharing, ride-sharing and lift-sharing) is the sharing of car journeys so that 
more than one person travels in a car, and prevents the need for others to have to drive to a location 
themselves.</p>

<p>Drivers and passengers offer and search for journeys through one of the several mediums 
available. After finding a match they contact each other to arrange any details for the journey(s). 
Costs, meeting points and other details like space for luggage are agreed on. They then meet and 
carry out their shared car journey(s) as planned.</p>

<p>By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each person's travel costs such fuel 
costs, tolls and the stress of driving. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during 
periods of high pollution or high fuel prices. Car sharing is a good way to use up the full seating 
capacity of a car, which would otherwise remain unused if it were just the driver using the car.</p>
